<h2>A TREE WITH VARIEGATED LEAVES.</h2>

<p>The following communications have found their way into the
Editor's box at 85, Fleet Street, and are published that their writers
may claim them. As most of the signatures were more or less
illegible, it has been considered advisable to suppress them, to
prevent the possibility of mistakes. The only exception that has
been made to this rule is in the case of the last letter, wherein
seemingly is summed up the moral of the controversy.</p>

<p class="titleit"><i>Communication No. 1, dated Tuesday.</i></p>

<p>Is it not time, considering that there is nothing of particular
interest attracting public attention, that a protest should be raised
against the "Society" plays which occupy the stages of some of our
best theatres? You see I pave the way to my gentle reproof by buttering
up vested interests. To do this the better, I will say something
nice about "our most capable actors," and write "I remember
<span class="sc">Buckstone</span>, and <span class="sc">Sothern</span>, the <span class="sc">Bancrofts</span>, and, aye, Mr.
<span class="sc">Tree</span>
himself." This will prove that there is no malice in my suggestions.</p>

<p>Let me describe the piece to which, in the dead season of the year,
I object. The plot is centred in the love for each other of a
partially-reclaimed
lady and an opium-drinking gentleman; I might
use stronger expressions, but I know your paper is intended for the
family rather than the dress-circle, and my language is therefore
modulated to meet the modest requirements of the case. Take it
from me, Sir, that the story of these two individuals is nauseous and
degrading. I say that its unravelling should not be foisted on the
public in a modern play. But that you may not consider my impressions
libellous, I add that the piece is finely staged, and in parts
well written. For all that, I cannot imagine why the manager, with
his lofty ideas of the function of a theatre as a medium of education,
has permitted himself to produce it. And if that observation does
not draw the manager in question, my name is not X. Y. Z.</p>

<p class="titleit"><i>Communication No. 2, dated Wednesday.</i></p>

<p>Your anonymous contributor "of London" (mark the sarcasm!)
was right in imagining that I would be drawn. I consider it my
duty to Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Arthur Jones</span> to say something about his
"accustomed combative geniality," and to Mr. <span class="sc">Haddon Chambers</span> to
refer to his "cheery stoicism." I will also allude to Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span>, but
as he is not writing for my theatre just now, merely record my conviction
that he will be able to survive the sneers against <i>The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray</i>&mdash;"a play which has made a deep and lasting impression
on the thinking public." And when I write "lasting,"
I am the more obliging, as I assume the <i>rôle</i> of a prophet. It will be
"lasting," I am sure. The "thinking public," of course, are those
admirable and intellectual persons who fill the stalls and boxes of my
theatre, and the stalls and boxes of kindred establishments.</p>

<p>And, while I am talking of "thinking," let me insist that the
criticism of the piece by the anonymous one "of London" (mark the
irony!) is not a personal matter, but a question that affects the
freedom of the thinking community. This is a generation that has
outgrown "the skirts of the young lady of fifteen"; and it behoves
all to understand the meaning of that apt sentence, and to regard
with a jealous eye any attempt to crib, cabin, and confine the
development of contemporary thought. "Crib, cabin, and confine"
is also good, and entirely worthy of your serious consideration. At
a time when the stalls are 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and the family-circle
available
to those who will not run to gold, is a literary dandy (in whose
stained forefinger I seem to detect the sign of an old journalistic
hand) to pass a vote of censure on <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> because, forsooth,
<i>Hamlet</i> was not forgotten? I trust not. And shall the public
(mark you the intellectual, the praiseworthy&mdash;in a word, the
"thinking public") be debarred from taking their piece in their
favourite theatre because, forsooth, there is an interesting correspondence
in newspapers in the dullest season of the decrepit old
year? Again&mdash;I trust not.</p>

<p class="titleit"><i>Communication No. 3&mdash;once more dated Wednesday.</i></p>

<p>I beg to ask your permission, as an old playgoer, to see myself in
print. I do not pretend to be able to write myself, but an eminent
<i>littérateur</i>, in a recent number of a popular monthly magazine, has
done good service by enforcing the untruthful character of the
"problem" pieces recently presented to the public audiences. I have
not the ability to comment on this unpleasant phase of the histrionic
profession, so merely observe (with a recollection of an old-world
story) "them's my sentiments."</p>

<p class="titleit"><i>Communication No. 4, dated Thursday.</i></p>

<p>No doubt this letter will reach you with many others, with signatures
anonymous and otherwise. Being a bit spiteful I will confine
myself to five lines in the hope of gaining insertion. Are not pieces
with "girls with a past" played out? Then why slay the slain? I
am sure healthier work will now be submitted to the public. And
when that happy time arrives there will be found on my bookshelves
certain brown-paper-covered tomes that are waiting the inspection
of every actor-manager in London. Need I say more? You yourself,
Sir, will practically answer the question.</p>

<p class="titleit"><i>Communication No. 5, dated Friday.</i></p>

<p>Permit me to keep the ball a rolling. Why is the "young lady
of fifteen" to be alone protected? Are not the boys and girls of
an older growth to be also preserved from contamination? What is
to be done for that large class of playgoers who have entered their
second childhood?</p>

<p class="titleit"><i>Communication No. 6, dated Saturday.</i></p>

<p>Now that a piece at present being played at a West-End theatre
has been well advertised for a whole week in the more largely-read
columns of a most influential daily paper, it is to be sincerely
hoped that <i>Box</i> and <i>Cox</i> are satisfied.</p>

<div class="poem1">  <div class="stanza">

<p class="i4">This chilling day. "How many weary steps</p>
<p class="i4">Of many weary miles you have o'ergone!"</p>
<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> "We number nothing that we spend for you:</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch.</i> As <i>you</i> have done, my Prince, at sorrow's flood</p>

<span class="sc">P.M.</span></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself, alone</i>). I'm rather sorry that that Miss
<span class="sc">Spelwane</span> couldn't stay. She's a trifle angular&mdash;but clever. It
was distinctly sharp of her to see through that fellow <span class="sc">Spurrell</span> from
the first, and lay such an ingenious little trap for him. And she
has a great feeling for Literature&mdash;knows my verses by heart, I
discovered, quite accidentally. All the same, I wish she hadn't
intercepted those snowdrops. Now I shall have to go out and pick
some more. (<i>Sounds outside in the entrance hall.</i>) Too late&mdash;they've

<span class="sc">Rhoda</span>, in the sense that I have
hitherto failed to discover any form
of creed that commands my intellectual
assent.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>unimpressed</i>). I expect
you haven't tried. Are you a&mdash;what
d'ye call it?&mdash;a Lacedemoniac?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>with lofty tolerance</i>). I <i>presume</i>
you mean a "Laodicean."
No, I should rather describe myself
as a Deist.</p>

<p><i>Archie</i> (<i>in a surly undertone</i>).
What's a <i>Deast</i> when he's at
home? If he'd said a <i>Beast</i> now!
(<i>Aloud, as</i> <span class="sc">Pilliner</span> <i>enters with</i>
Captain <span class="sc">Thicknesse</span>.) Hullo, why
here's <span class="sc">Thicknesse</span>! So you <i>haven't</i>
gone after all, then?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> What an
observant young beggar you are,
<span class="sc">Bearpark</span>! Nothin' escapes you.
No, I haven't. (<i>To</i> Sir <span class="sc">Rupert</span>,
<i>rather sheepishly</i>.) Fact is, Sir, I&mdash;I
somehow just missed the train,
and&mdash;and&mdash;thought I might as well
come back, instead of waitin' about,
don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>heartily</i>). Why, of
course, my dear boy, of course!
Never have forgiven you if you
<i>hadn't</i>. Great nuisance for <i>you</i>, though. Hope you blew the fool
of a man up; he <i>ought</i> to have been round in plenty of time.</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;when you come to think over it all quietly&mdash;you
<i>will</i>."</p></div>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Not the groom's fault, Sir. I kept him waitin' a
bit, and&mdash;and we had to stop to shift the seat and that, and so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Great blundering booby! Can't he see nobody
wants him <i>here!</i> As if he hadn't bored poor Lady <span class="sc">Maisie</span> enough
at breakfast! Ah, well, I must come to her rescue once more,
I suppose!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Half an hour to lunch! Anybody like to come round to
the stables? I'm going to see how my wife's horse <i>Deerfoot</i> is
getting on. Fond of horses, eh, Mr.&mdash;a&mdash;<span class="sc">Undershell</span>? Care to
come with us?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I've seen quite enough of <i>that</i> beast
already!
(<i>Aloud, with some asperity.</i>) You must really excuse me, Sir
<span class="sc">Rupert</span>. I am at one with Mr. <span class="sc">Ruskin</span>&mdash;I <i>detest</i> horses.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Ah? Pity. We're rather fond of 'em here. But we
can't expect a poet to be a sportsman, eh?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> For my own poor part, I confess I look forward to a day,
not far distant, when the spread of civilisation will have abolished
every form of so-called Sport.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> <i>Do</i> you, though? (<i>After conquering a choke with
difficulty.</i>) Allow me to hope that you will continue to enjoy the
pleasures of anticipation as long as possible. (<i>To the rest.</i>) Well,
are you coming?</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>All except</i> <span class="sc">Undershell</span> <i>follow their host out</i>.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>alone, to himself</i>). If they think I'm going to be
<i>patronised</i>, or suppress my honest convictions&mdash;&mdash;! Now I'll go and pick
those&mdash;&mdash; (Lady <span class="sc">Maisie</span> <i>enters from the Conservatory</i>.) Ah, Lady
<span class="sc">Maisie</span>, I have been trying to find you. I had plucked a few
snowdrops, which I promised myself the pleasure of presenting to
you. Unfortunately they&mdash;er&mdash;failed to reach their destination.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>distantly</i>). Thanks, Mr. <span class="sc">Blair</span>; I am only
sorry you should have given yourself such unnecessary trouble.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>detaining her, as she seemed about to pass on</i>). I have
another piece of intelligence which you may hear less&mdash;er&mdash;philosophically,
Lady <span class="sc">Maisie</span>. Your <i>bête noire</i> has returned.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>with lifted eyebrows</i>). My <i>bête noire</i>, Mr.
<span class="sc">Blair</span>?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Why affect not to understand? I have an infallible instinct
in all matters concerning <i>you</i>, and,
sweetly tolerant as you are, I instantly
divined what an insufferable
nuisance you found our military
friend, Captain <span class="sc">Thicknesse</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> There are limits
even to <i>my</i> tolerance, Mr. <span class="sc">Blair</span>.
I admit I find some people insufferable&mdash;but
Captain <span class="sc">Thicknesse</span> is
not one of them.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Then appearances are deceptive
indeed. Come, Lady <span class="sc">Maisie</span>, surely you can trust Me!</p>

<p class="rindent">[Lady <span class="sc">Cantire</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>in her most awful
tones</i>). <span class="sc">Maisie</span>, my dear, I appear
to have interrupted an interview of
a somewhat confidential character.
If so, pray let me know it, and I
will go elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>calmly</i>). Not in the
very least, Mamma. Mr. <span class="sc">Blair</span>
was merely trying to prepare me
for the fact that Captain <span class="sc">Thicknesse</span>
has come back; which was
quite needless, as I happen to have
heard it already from his own lips.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Captain <span class="sc">Thicknesse</span>
come back! (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Undershell</span>.) I
wish to speak to my daughter.
May I ask you to leave us?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> With pleasure, Lady <span class="sc">Cantire</span>.
(<i>To himself, as he retires.</i>)
What a consummate actress that
girl is! And what a coquette!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>after a silence</i>).
<span class="sc">Maisie</span>, what does all this mean?
No <i>nonsense</i> now! What brought
<span class="sc">Gerald Thicknesse</span> back?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I <i>suppose</i> the dog-cart,
Mamma. He missed his train,
you know. I don't think he minds&mdash;much.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Let me tell you
<i>this</i>, my dear. It is a great deal
more than you <i>deserve</i> after&mdash;&mdash; How
long has he come back for?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Only a few hours;
but&mdash;but from things he said, I
fancy he would stay on longer&mdash;if Aunt <span class="sc">Albinia</span> asked him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Then we may consider that settled; he stays. (Lady
<span class="sc">Culverin</span> <i>appears</i>.) Here <i>is</i> your Aunt. You had better
leave us,
my dear.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Somewhat Later; the Party have Assembled for Lunch.</span></p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>to his wife</i>). Well, my dear, I've seen that young

and you'll be glad to hear he can't find anything seriously wrong
with <i>Deerfoot</i>.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>in the background, to himself</i>). No more could I, for that
matter!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> He's clear it isn't navicular, which <span class="sc">Adams</span> was afraid
of, and he thinks, with care and rest, you know, the horse will be as
fit as a fiddle in a very few days.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Just exactly what I <i>told</i> them; but the
fools wouldn't believe <i>me!</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Oh, <span class="sc">Rupert</span>, I <i>am</i> so glad. How clever of
that nice Mr. <span class="sc">Spurrell</span>! I was afraid my poor <i>Deerfoot</i> would have to
be shot.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She may thank me that he <i>wasn't</i>. And
this other fellow gets all the credit for it. How like Life!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> And, Uncle <span class="sc">Rupert</span>, how about&mdash;about
<span class="sc">Phillipson</span>,
you know? Is it all right?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> <span class="sc">Phillipson?</span> Oh, why, 'pon my word, my dear, didn't
think of asking.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> But <i>I</i> did, <span class="sc">Maisie</span>. And they met this mornin',
and it's all settled, and they're as happy as they can be. Except
that he's on the look out for a mysterious stranger, who disappeared
last night, after tryin' to make desperate love to her. He is determined,
if he can find him, to give him a piece of his mind.</p>

<p class="rindent">[<span class="sc">Undershell</span> <i>disguises his extreme uneasiness.</i></p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> And the whole of a horsewhip. He invited my opinion

would impart "proficiency in the <i>trois temps</i>, as danced in the most
select circles," in a single lesson to a lame bear.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I don't stir a step out of this house while I'm
here, that's all!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Ha-ha! Athletic young chap that. Glad to see him
in the field next Tuesday. By the way, <span class="sc">Albinia</span>, you've heard
how <span class="sc">Thicknesse</span> here contrived to miss his train this morning?
Our gain, of course; but still we must manage to get you back to
Aldershot to-night, my boy, or you'll get called over the coals by
your Colonel when you <i>do</i> put in an appearance, hey? Now, let's
see; what train ought you to catch?</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>He takes up "Bradshaw" from a writing-table.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>possessing herself of the volume</i>). Allow me,
<span class="sc">Rupert</span>,
my eyes are better than yours. <i>I</i> will look out his trains for him.
(<i>After consulting various pages.</i>) Just as I <i>thought!</i> Quite
impossible
for him to reach North Camp to-night now. There isn't a
train till six, and <i>that</i> gets to town just too late for him to drive
across to Waterloo and catch the last Aldershot train. So there's no
more to be said.</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>She puts "Bradshaw" away.</i></p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> (<i>with undisguised relief</i>). Oh, well, dessay they
won't kick up much of a row if I don't get back till to-morrow,&mdash;or
the day <i>after</i>, if it comes to that.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It <i>shan't</i> come to that&mdash;if <i>I</i> can
prevent it!
Lady <span class="sc">Maisie</span> is quite in despair, I can see. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Indeed?
I was&mdash;a&mdash;not aware that discipline was quite so lax as that in the
British Army. And surely officers should set an example of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>He finds that his intervention has produced a distinct sensation,
and, taking up the discarded "Bradshaw," becomes
engrossed in its study.</i></p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> (<i>ignoring him completely</i>). It's like this, Lady
<span class="sc">Culverin</span>.
Somehow I&mdash;I muddled up the dates, don't you know. Mean
to say, got it into my head to-day was the 20th, instead of only
the 18th. (<i>Lamely.</i>) That's how it <i>was</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Delightful, my dear <span class="sc">Gerald</span>. Then we shall keep
you here till Tuesday, of <i>course!</i></p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>looking up from "Bradshaw," impulsively</i>). Lady
<span class="sc">Culverin</span>,
I see there's a very good train which leaves Shuntingbridge
at 3.15 this afternoon, and gets&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>The rest regard him with unaffected surprise and disapproval.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>raising her glasses</i>). Upon my word, Mr.

you will kindly leave Captain <span class="sc">Thicknesse</span> to make his own
arrangements&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>interposing hastily</i>). But, Mamma, you must have
misunderstood Mr. <span class="sc">Blair</span>! As if he would <i>dream</i> of&mdash;&mdash;. He was
merely mentioning the train he wishes to go by himself. <i>Weren't</i>
you, Mr. <span class="sc">Blair</span>?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>blinking and gasping</i>). I&mdash;eh? Just so, that&mdash;that <i>was</i>
my intention, certainly. (<i>To himself.</i>) Does she at all realise what this
will cost her?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> My dear Mr. <span class="sc">Blair</span>, I&mdash;I'd no notion we were to lose
you so soon; but if you're really quite <i>sure</i> you must go&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>sharply</i>). Really, <span class="sc">Albinia</span>, we must give him
credit
for knowing his own mind. He tells you he is <i>obliged to go!</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Then of course we must let you do <i>exactly</i> as you
please. (<i>All, except</i> Miss <span class="sc">Spelwane</span>, <i>breathe more freely</i>;
<span class="sc">Tredwell</span>

see that some one packs Mr. <span class="sc">Undershell's</span> things for him, and
tell them to send the dogcart round after lunch in time to catch
the 3.15 from Shuntingbridge.</p>

<p><i>Pill.</i> (<i>sotto voce, to</i> <span class="sc">Archie</span>). And let us pray that the
cart is
properly balanced <i>before</i> starting, <i>this</i> time!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>to herself, piqued</i>). Going already! I wish I had

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> Well, shall we go in to lunch, everybody?</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>They move in irregular order towards the Dining Hall.</i></p>

quite understand your precise motive in suggesting so&mdash;so hasty a
departure.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>without looking at him</i>). Don't you, Mr.

Perhaps&mdash;when you come to think over it all quietly&mdash;you <i>will</i>.</p>

just&mdash;&mdash;Why,
yes, I <i>do!</i> That bully <span class="sc">Spurrell</span> with his beastly horsewhip! She
dreads an encounter between us&mdash;and I should much prefer to avoid it
myself. Yes, that's it, of course; she is willing to sacrifice anything
rather than endanger <i>my</i> personal safety! What unselfish angels
some women are! Even that sneering fellow <span class="sc">Drysdale</span> will be impressed
when I tell him this.... Yes, it's best that I should go&mdash;I
see that now. I don't so much mind leaving. Without any false
humility, I can hardly avoid seeing that, even in the short time
I have been among these people, I have produced a decided impression.
And there is at least one&mdash;perhaps <i>two</i>&mdash;who will miss me

<p>I have bin a having quite a long tork with a most respecful looking
Gent who tells me he is a reel County Counsellor, and that they
has a Gildhall of their own at Charing Cross, where they meets ewery
week, the same as the Common Counsellors does at their reel Gildhall
in the Citty, and that they has quite made up
their minds to make the two Gildhalls into one
and have them both for theirselves, and that
that will be what they calls Hunifikashun,
which means everything for them and not
nothink for nobody else.</p>

<p>Not content with what they have got allreddy
they means to have all the Citty Perlice, and
the Manshun House, and all the Citty's Money,
and the rite to all the Tems Water, and to the
<span class="sc">Lord Mare</span> and Sherryfs Carridges, and to the
Old Bayley, and to more other things than I can
manage to remember! And he really speaks of
all these warious matters jest as if he was quite
in ernest, and acshally expected as it woud all
be done by the next Parlement when they met
next year! And when he found as I reelly
didn't beleeve a word of his wunderful stories,
he acshally arsked me to go with him to their
Gildhall at Charing Cross, and there he put me
in a nice seat, and then I heard em all torking
away, jest as if they were quite in ernest, all about the many
wunderful things as they was about to do soon! Oh, I wunders how
long it will be before any on em reelly happens? Not in my life
time I'll be bound, nor most likely in nobody elses! Did any
reesonable man, woman or child ever hear such a pack of nonsense?
To acshally defraud the grand old Citty of Lundon, that is only jest
about seven hunderd year old, of all their priwileges and all their
rites and all their money! and then I shoud like to know what is to
become of me, and the duzzens like me? Nice lots of Lord Mares
and Alldermen these County Counsellors woud make! Why I
acshally douts whether they coud even manage to make up a decent
lot of Common Counselmen under at least a year.</p>

<p>There was one thing as I heard them squabling about while I was
there, and that was the nessessity of having some more lunatic
asylums, which did not much surprise me, as I shoud think they
will soon want a pretty good number for theirselves, if they continnes
to go on as they are going.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Brown</span> told me a rayther funny story about the dredful solemnity
of these wunderful County Counsellors. He says they have by sum
means or other got the right of insistin that there shall be no fun in
the theaters, and no warking about between the hacts; and that the
publick got so disgusted with the silly regerlations, that in many
cases they left off going to them for ewer so long; but they are
better now, and will most likely soon go back to their old armless
jokes.</p>

<h3>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h3>

<p><i>Kelt and Salted.</i>&mdash;It may be true, as you have
heard, that Mr. <span class="sc">Standish O'Grady</span> intends to
supplement his series of Ossianic stories, <i>Finn
and his Companions</i>, by a work entitled <i>Fin an'
Haddock</i>. But, we confess, the story seems a
little fishy.</p>

<p><i>A Brummagem Spoon.</i>&mdash;You are quite wrong.
The creation of the character of <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>
was, in point of time, far anterior to the invention
of the Self-working Noiseless Screw. Mr.
<span class="sc">Chamberlain's</span> playful application of the term
to Lord <span class="sc">Hartington</span> did not imply any proprietorship
in the article. The right hon. gentleman
was under the impression that he had
come across the character in the course of his
reading of <span class="sc">Dickens'</span> Christmas stories, and,
wanting to say something nice of his noble
friend, he just mentioned it. It led to some
misunderstanding at the time, but has now been
forgotten. See our answer to "Three Cows and
an Acre" in the Christmas Number.</p>

<p><i>Residuary Legatee.</i>&mdash;Certainly you may
recover, especially if you can get A. to refund
the money. Don't hesitate to sue. We make a
practice of never accepting fees. The 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
you enclosed (in stamps, postal order preferable)
we shall, at the first opportunity, place in the
Poor Box.</p>

<p><i>Perplexed.</i>&mdash;What do you mean by asking us
to tell you "If a herring and a-half costs three
hapence, how much will a dozen run you in
for?" This is just one of those simple problems
you can solve for yourself on reference to an
ordinary book of arithmetic. Do you suppose
we sit here to save the time of idle persons?
Our mission is to supply information drawn
from authorities not accessible to the average
subscriber.</p>

<p><i>Algernon and Sibyl.</i>&mdash;Consult Sir <span class="sc">George
Lewis</span>, Ely Place, Holborn, E.C. We never
advise on delicate subjects such as yours. It is
impossible for us to reply to correspondents
through the post. Our motto is <i>Audi altem
parterem</i>. As the lady may not be familiar
with the dead languages, we may perhaps
do well to translate. Freely rendered,
it means, "We desire that all parties
(<i>altem parterem</i>) may hear and profit
by our advice."</p>

<p><i>One-who-has-had-no-rest-to-speak-of-for-fifteen-years-owing-to-neuralgic-
pains-and-a-next-door-neighbour-who-plays-the-piano-night-and-day.</i>&mdash;No.</p>

<p><i>Beyond the Dreams of Avarice.</i>&mdash;Your
record of an incident in the early
life of Mr. <span class="sc">W. Astor</span> is very interesting.
"Musing by the waters of the mighty
Hudson he," you say, "conceived the
ambition of becoming one of the richest
men in the world." It is pleasing to
know that his recent entrance upon journalistic
enterprise is likely to realise his
boyhood's dream.</p>

<p><i>Advertisement Agent.</i>&mdash;There is, we
fear, no opening for you in this direction.
"Silonio" is not the name of a
new shaving soap, as you surmise. It
is the title of honour given by the delegates
of a remote but respectable African
race to a great and good British statesman.
Its literal translation into the
English tongue is, we are informed,
"Open-mouthed."</p>

<p><i>A Subscriber for Seventy Years.</i>&mdash;Your

<p>Ain't you rather wily?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>is perhaps a little monotonous in its interrogative
form. But it is not without
merit, especially from one of your
advanced age. A fatal objection is that
it should be out of date. The School-Board
Elections, we are glad to say, were
completed a fortnight ago. Try again&mdash;for

<h3>FIRST IMPRESSIONS.</h3>

<p>"There is nothing in Italy more beautiful
to me than the coast-road between Genoa and
Spezia." Remember these words of <span class="sc">Dickens</span>,
in his <i>Pictures from Italy</i>, as I start from
Pisa to see that lovely coast, and the Mediterranean,
for the first time.</p>

<p>Pisa is sleepy, but the railway officials are
wide awake. The man who sells me my
ticket "forgets" one lira. This answers
capitally with innocent old ladies from England
or Germany. The old lady counts her
change, and if she has carefully ascertained
the fare by reading the price marked on her
ticket, she finds at once that there is a halfpenny
wanting. She never learns that this
is the Government tax. "If you please," she
begins; or, "<i>Bitte</i>," and then she goes off
into&mdash;not hysterics, but French, and murmurs,
"<i>Seevooplay, je pongse vous devays
avoir donnay moi un sou</i>&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;more, <i>vous
comprenny?</i>" or, "<i>Il y a encore</i>&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;<i>fünfzig,
vous savay, à moi à payer.</i>" Then
the official answers, also in French, "<i>Ah
nong, Madame, ceci est la taxe doo gouvernemang
sul biglietto, capisce?</i>"</p>

<p>Whereupon the old lady is so agitated by
the thought that she has wrongfully accused
him of stealing a soldo, that she never notices
that he has withheld a lira. If she counts
her money later in the day, she will blame
those nasty lira notes, which stick together
so, that she must have given two somewhere
instead of one. But the railway clerk is also
prepared for any more exacting stranger, and
holds the extra note ready for him. The
clerk at Pisa does so, handing it to me, without
a word of objection or explanation, as
soon as I ask for it. The system is as perfect
as it is simple. Having obtained my change,
I start for the Mediterranean.</p>

<h3>THE TRUISMS OF LIFE.</h3>

<p class="title1">(<i>By the Right Hon. the Author of "The Platitudes
of Life," M.P., F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Chapter I.</span>&mdash;<i>De Omnibus Rebus.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Ars longa, vita brevis;</i>"<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> and indeed
"man wants but little here below, nor wants
that little long."<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> An oriental writer has
told us that "all flesh is grass," to which a
Scots poet<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> has replied, that "A man's a
man for a' that." There is a Greek aphorism,
not sufficiently well known, which says <ins title="Greek: gnôthi seauton">&gamma;&nu;&#8182;&theta;&iota; &sigma;&epsilon;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&#8057;&nu;</ins>.
This has been ably rendered by <span class="sc">Pope</span>
in the words "Know thyself."<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> Proverbially
"piety begins at home," but it is wrong
to deduce from this that education ends when
we leave school; "it goes on through life."<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Books are an educational force. They
"have often been compared to friends,"<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
whom we "never cut."<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> They "are better
than all the tarts and toys in the world."<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a>
It is not generally known that "English
literature is the inheritance of the English
race,"<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> on whose Empire, by the way, "the
sun never sets." We even have "books in
the running brooks," as the Bard of Avon<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>
tells us; so that not only "he that runs,"
but he that swims, "may read."</p>

<p>"Knowledge for the million,"<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> is the
"<i>fin de siècle</i>"<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a> cry of the hour. But "life
is real, life is earnest,"<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> and we have no
time to study original thinkers such as <span class="sc">Confucius</span>
and <span class="sc">Tupper</span>. "<i>Altiora Peto</i>"<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> is a
saying for the leisured class only. The mass
must get its wisdom second-hand and concentrated.
If "reading maketh a full man,"<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>
this kind of reading maketh a man to burst.
Hence the "sad in sweet"<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> of the book of
quoted platitudes. Yet, of course, "there
are great ways of borrowing. Genius borrows
nobly."<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a> And it is well to have "the
courage of" other people's "opinions."</p>

<p>But reading is not all. You must "use
your head."<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a> And you must, and can,
keep it too. For a good man's head is not
like a seed-cake that passes in the using.
And, again, remember the proverb that "manners
makyth man"; though this is not the
true cause of the over-population of our
islands. In social life much will depend on
the way in which you behave to others.
"Never lose your temper, and if you do, at
any rate hold your tongue, and try not to show
it"<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a>&mdash;except, one may add, to a doctor.</p>

<p>Many people cannot say "No!" Others
early learn to say "No!" when asked to do
disagreeable things. "<i>Mens sana in corpore</i>
sano." If the last word is pronounced <i>Say
No</i>, this constitutes a word-play. There are
some bad word-plays in <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>. I disapprove
of humour, new or old.</p>

<p>"No man who knows what his income is,
and what he is spending, will run into extravagance."<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a>
<span class="sc">Plutarch</span> tells us of a man
whose income was £500, and he spent £5000 a
year knowingly. This must have been an
exceptional case. There is an obscure dictum
that "money is the root of all evil." "Gold!
gold!"<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a> said an ill-known poet, and, on the
other hand, "Hail, independence!"<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a> said

<h3>THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.</h3>

<p class="title1">VI.&mdash;<span class="sc">Preparing for the Poll.</span></p>

<p>When I do a thing, I like to do it properly, for even my
worst enemies, who call me a fool, admit that I'm a <i>thorough</i> fool.
I have accordingly lost no time in getting to work at my electoral
campaign. I commenced at a great disadvantage. The other seven
candidates were electioneering for a week before the Parish Meeting,
and the result was that they all
polled three times as many votes
as I did. That has happened
once. I don't intend that it shall
happen more than once.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 180px;"><a href="images/288a-530.png"><img src="images/288a-150.png" width="150" height="158" alt="'Vote for Winkins&mdash;a good All-round Man.'" /></a>
<p>"Vote for Winkins&mdash;a good All-round Man."</p></div>

<p>The first move I made was to
cover my house with placards. I
noticed that in a recent election
Mr. <span class="sc">Athelston Riley</span> had pursued
these tactics with great
success, so I plastered the whole
of the walls with "<span class="sc">Winkins
for Mudford</span>"&mdash;"<span class="sc">Vote for
Winkins</span>,"&mdash;but thereby hangs
a tale. I gave my instructions to
the local printer, and told him
where they were to be posted,
directing him to do it in the
twilight, so that the whole effect
might dawn once and for ever
upon an astonished village in the morning. He did it, but unfortunately
he didn't keep a proof-reader. I noticed next day,
before I went out, that all the school-children looked up at the
house and giggled. I thought it was merely the inappreciativeness
of the youthful mind. There I was wrong. It was the fact that the
children knew how to spell that caused the mischief. My house was
covered with appeals to "<span class="sc">Wote for Vinkins!</span>" It did not take
long to get new bills printed, but I am not disposed to deny I was a
trifle disconcerted by this false start.</p>

<p>I am now hard at work canvassing. My wife flatly declines to
help, and I'm afraid to suggest the girls should take the field in support
of their father. I tried to secure the services of the vicar's two
daughters, but he only wrote rather a stiff note to say that he thought
they would have quite enough to do in advocating his claims. I am
not always at one with the clergy, but for once I agree with him. I
<i>have</i> succeeded, however, in getting Miss <span class="sc">Phill Burtt</span> to help me.
Her full name is, of course, <span class="sc">Phyllis</span>; but it's always called and
spelt "<span class="sc">Phill</span>"&mdash;I could never understand why. She's a most delightful
girl, and is worth, at least, a hundred votes to me. As I explained
once before, she has an extraordinary habit of calling all the
villagers "idiots"&mdash;of course, I mean to her friends (such as myself),
not to the villagers themselves. I asked her one day why, if she
thought them idiots, she was kind enough to take the trouble to
canvass them. "Well, you see," she said with a charming smile that
was all her own; "I'm asking them to vote for <i>you</i>." At the time
I thought this was a pretty saying, prettily said. I even told it with
some amount of pride to my wife just to show her that there were
people who did not sympathise with her haughty indifference.
Curiously enough my wife only laughed consumedly. When she had
recovered, I asked her why she laughed. "Do you <i>really</i> mean to
say, <span class="sc">Timothy</span>," was her reply, "that you don't see what she meant?"</p>

<p>"Well, though it may seem idiotic...." I said, and was going to
add, "I don't," but before I said that, I <i>did</i> see what she
(<span class="sc">Phyllis</span>,
of course, I mean) <i>might</i> have meant. Yet I hope she didn't. Miss
<span class="sc">Burtt</span> has only one drawback as a canvasser. She is so ridiculously
scrupulous, I came across an old woman the other day who was quite
deaf to my appeals. Whilst I reasoned with her, I found out how
kind <span class="sc">Phyllis</span> was to her. "Miss <span class="sc">Phill</span>, she's really good to us
poor people. I'd vote for <i>her</i> if she was standing." I left, having
produced no impression. A day or two after I met Miss <span class="sc">Phill
Burtt</span>, and asked her to go and canvass the old woman; I felt sure
she could secure her vote. Will it be believed that she wouldn't?
She said it would be really undue influence if she did. How strange
that even the nicest of women are so strangely unpractical at times!
Another woman she refused to see because she never called upon her
at ordinary times. Still, with all her faults, Miss <span class="sc">Burtt</span> is a tower
of strength, and as I see her daily going about, canvass book in
hand, my hopes rise higher and higher.</p>

<h2 class="sans">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/288b-480.png"><img src="images/288b-200.png" width="200" height="229" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Philip Sidney</span> was, as all the world knows, "a veray parfit
gentil knight." Possibility of this presupposition of knowledge is
fortunate, since Miss <span class="sc">Anna M. Stoddart's</span> account of this heroic
figure is not, my Baronite sorrowfully says, likely to convey any
adequate idea of its personality. Mr. <span class="sc">Fox Bourne</span> and Mr.
<span class="sc">Addington Symonds</span> have written
biographies of the Elizabethan
soldier, in which he boldly stands
forth. Miss <span class="sc">Stoddart</span> modestly
says her object is "in no way to
compete with" these standard
works. But why write at all?
The marvel is, as Dr. <span class="sc">Johnson</span>
did not exactly say in illustration
of an argument respecting another
feminine achievement, not that
the work should not have been
well done, but that it possibly
could be done with such wooden
effect. If Miss <span class="sc">Stoddart</span> had
taken a sheet of paper and with
her pair of scissors cut out the
figure of a man, writing across it
"This is <span class="sc">Philip Sidney</span>," she
would have conveyed quite as clear and moving a picture of the man
as is found in the 111 pages of her book. But then, Mr. <span class="sc">Blackwood</span>
would not have published the scrap of paper, and we should not have
had the charming portrait of <span class="sc">Sidney</span>, or the sketches of Penshurst by
<span class="sc">Margaret L. Huggins</span> which adorn the daintily got-up volume.</p>

<p>My Baronitess writes:&mdash;<span class="sc">S. Baring Gould</span> turns into delightful
English prose some of the ancient Icelandic Sagas, or songs, and shows
us how <i>Grettir the Outlaw</i> was a Grettir man than was generally supposed
by anyone who had never heard very much about him. When
he departed, was he very much Re-grettir'd by all who knew him?</p>

<p>Messrs. <span class="sc">Macmillan</span> offer <i>My New Home</i>, provided by Mrs.
<span class="sc">Molesworth</span>, which many of the little "new" women would like to
see. Illustrated by <span class="sc">L. Leslie Brooke</span>: "<span class="sc">Brooke</span>" suggests "water
colours,"&mdash;a new idea for <i>next</i> Christmas.</p>

<p><i>Sou'-wester and Sword</i>, by <span class="sc">Hugh St. Leger</span>. A nautical and
military combination. The Sou'wester of a tar is not at all at sea
when, after a pleasant little shipwreck, he joins the forces at
Suakim. The winner of <i>this</i> <span class="sc">St. Leger</span> was a rank outsider, with
the odds against him, but he wins the day by "throstling" (a new
word) a few Soudanese; who must have seemed quite forty to one!</p>

<p>A cousin, especially a Colonial, is such a very pleasant indistinct
sort of relative, that he is bound to be a hero of romance, though
perhaps a cousin at hand is worth two in the bush; at least, so
thinks the heroine in <i>My Cousin from Australia</i>, by <span class="sc">Evelyn
Everett Green</span> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson &amp; Co.</span>); whilst the one whom she
should have wed was of course a wicked Baronet (does one often meet a
good Baronet in fiction?), who tries to upset his successful rival by
giving him a tip over an agreeably high cliff. It is a Christmas story,
and so the "tip" is just at the right time. How it ends&mdash;&mdash;You'll see.</p>

<p><i>Black and White</i> has gone in for a shilling's worth of the truly
wonderful in <i>The Dream Club</i>, by <span class="sc">Barrie Pain</span> and <span class="sc">Eden
Philpotts</span>. It is quite an after-turkey, plum-pudding, mince-pie
dinner story. How authors and artists must have suffered, judging,
at least, by the delightful nightmare illustrations. And the picture-lady
of the cover&mdash;ahem!&mdash;she has evidently forgotten that she is
supposed to be "out" at Christmas.</p>

<p>Between the boards of <span class="sc">Lothar Meggendorfer's</span> moveable toy-books
(<span class="sc">H. Grevel &amp; Co.</span>) lies genuine fun. <i>The Scenes of the Life of
a Masher</i> are simply irresistible. Little ones will be delighted with
<i>The Transformation Scenes</i>, besides, there is <i>Charming Variety</i> with
a <i>Party of Six</i>. These books are a good tip for a Christmas gift for
the representatives of Tommy and Harry.</p>

<p>Had <span class="sc">G. W. Appleton's</span> <i>The Co-Respondent</i>&mdash;an attractive
title&mdash;been
in the form of a short magazine story, it would probably have
been amusing from first to last. Now it is only amusing at first.
Good idea all the same. The old quotation about "Sir <span class="sc">Hubert
Stanley</span>" is brought in, and, of course, incorrectly. It is not
"<i>Praise</i> from Sir <span class="sc">Hubert Stanley</span>," but "approbation." However,
as it is said by a light-hearted girl of a very modern type, it may be
assumed that the misquotation is intentional.</p>
